# FULL Stacks AI: From Theory to Practice

## Overview

Welcome to the **FULL Stacks AI** course! This course is designed to take you from foundational concepts in artificial intelligence (AI) to deploying fully functional AI solutions in real-world applications. You'll learn the essential mathematical, programming, and machine learning skills required to build, train, and deploy AI models, while also gaining experience with industry-standard tools and techniques.

By the end of the course, you will have a strong understanding of AI, machine learning, and deep learning concepts, and youâ€™ll be able to apply these skills in practical projects.

## Course Objectives

The objectives of this course are to:
- Understand the fundamentals of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
- Develop a solid foundation in the mathematics that underpins AI (e.g., linear algebra, statistics, probability).
- Gain proficiency in Python programming and tools for data science and AI development.
- Explore various machine learning techniques (supervised and unsupervised learning).
- Master deep learning concepts and their applications in computer vision, natural language processing, and AI generative models.
- Learn to deploy AI solutions in real-world environments using tools like Flask, Docker, and continuous integration pipelines.
- Understand the ethical and regulatory considerations surrounding AI, including interpretability and bias in AI systems.

## Course Structure

This course is divided into three main modules:

1. **AI Fundamentals and Tools**  
   Introduction to the core concepts and tools needed to build AI models, including Python, Git, and mathematics for AI.

2. **Artificial Intelligence Techniques**  
   Deep dive into machine learning, deep learning, and AI applications such as computer vision, natural language processing, and AI ethics.

3. **AI in Industry**  
   Focus on deploying AI models, using big data tools, creating ETL pipelines, and deploying models with APIs and dashboards.

Each module includes theory and practical exercises, culminating in a final capstone project where you will build, train, and deploy an AI solution from start to finish.

## Prerequisites

To succeed in this course, you should have:
- Basic understanding of programming (preferably Python).
- Some familiarity with linear algebra, statistics, and probability.
- Willingness to learn and explore new concepts in machine learning and AI.

## Required Tools

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python** (version 3.7 or higher)  
  You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for interactive coding)  
  Install it using the following command:
  ```bash
  pip install notebook
    ```
- **Git** (for version control and collaborating on projects)
Download from git-scm.com.

- **Python Libraries** :
You will need several Python libraries for machine learning and data science. To install them, you can run the following command in your terminal:

- **Docker** (for containerizing and deploying applications)
